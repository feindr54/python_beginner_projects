# python_beginner_projects
## What is this?
This is a collection of simple codes that I have written while enrolled in an Intro to Python course on Udemy by Jose Portilla. It was a pretty fun 1-2 months spent that really helped me to brush up on my programming knowledge, and brought me into a new world of convenience (poor guy started on Java).

## Is there any further use of this repository?
It's hard to say... maybe if I could think of other simple projects I would include it in...
